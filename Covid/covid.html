                Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to 
                reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Make 
                wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate
                use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as 
                effective as possible.

            <h3>
                Open a window. Increase the amount of ‘natural ventilation’ when indoors.
