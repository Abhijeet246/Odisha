        <h2>WHAT TO DO TO KEEP YOURSELF AND OTHERS SAFE FROM COVID-19 ?</h2>
        <p>
          Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to
          reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Make
          wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The
          appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to
          make masks as effective as possible.

          <li>
            Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close
            contact.
          </li>

          <li>
            Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones,
            particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air
            coming in
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid crowded or indoor settings but if you can’t, then take
            precautions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open a window. Increase the amount of ‘natural ventilation’ when
            indoors.

            Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
            rub or wash them with soap and water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces
            and can pick up viruses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you
            cough or sneeze.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are
            regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.

            Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common
            symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as
            cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover.
          </li>
          <li>
            Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone
            bring you supplies
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
            attention immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such
            as WHO or your local and national health authorities.
